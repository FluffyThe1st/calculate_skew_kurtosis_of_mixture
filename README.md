# calculate_skew_kurtosis_of_mixture

This code shows the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis with the function "show". It is part of the data simulation of my master's thesis. This show-function needs only one value, namely the mean2, which is the mean of the second mixture component. I used 1.355 and 2.8 In the MT.
